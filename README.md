# ECEN-5813-Project3
 Create a memory test utility to run against allocated heap memory on the KL25Z
This third PES project will extend the use of the KL25Z with the MCUXpresso IDE to memory and pointer operations as well as creae a UML diagramming that we discussed in class. As if creating a test for memory on a new board, you’ll create a command processor to run tests against memory by parsing a script, and you’ll create the first phase of a logger utility to trace program execution.

# Observation
The project was very simple but as programs we made it very complex. We spent more time on the pattern generator function than we should have. We spend more timeon the display function than we should have as well. But overall we created functions that will come in handy in future project. We learned some very valuable lessions on how to allocate memory and understaning the memory space of the KL25Z.
